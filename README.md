# Geometry2Sphere

## Overview

Geometry2Sphere (G2S) is a $SO(3)$-equivariant model designed to map 3D geometric inputs to continuous spherical signals. G2S operates entirely in Fourier space, encoding geometric structure into latent Fourier features using equivariant neural networks and then outputting the Fourier coefficients of the output signal. Combining these coefficients with spherical harmonics enables the simultaneous prediction of all values of the continuous spherical signal at any resolution.

### Experiments
Many modeling tasks take an object mesh as input and predict a physical property of that object. If the property depends on a direction vector, that is, a spherical coordinate $(\theta, \phi)$, then the output may be represented as a continuous function defined on the 2-sphere. This reposiory focuses on evaluating the performance of G2S on two supervised learning tasks, predicting radar response and aerodynamic drag. For use of a G2S model on policy learning see [Fourier Value Functions](https://github.com/ColinKohler/fourier_value_functions).
